# Editing Model

Littera treats editing as **semantic refactoring**.

---

## Bilingual Editing

The editor supports split-panel bilingual editing:
- One language active
- One language previewing or editable
- Live alignment proposals

Users may switch between:
- Manual mode (no auto changes)
- Assisted mode (proposals + approval)
- Auto-sync mode (preview + undo)

---

## Alignment Rules

- Alignment is block-level
- Many-to-many mappings allowed
- Drift is detected, not forbidden

---

## Philosophy

The editor exists to support bilingual thinking, not batch translation.
Meaning always has priority over literal equivalence.
