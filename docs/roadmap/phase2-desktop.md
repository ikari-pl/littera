# Phase 2 — Immersive Desktop Writing

## Goal

Provide a calm, WYSIWYG‑leaning writing environment backed by Littera’s model.

---

## Principles

- Metadata is hidden, not destroyed
- Structure persists invisibly
- Writing flow is prioritized

---

## Capabilities

- Full‑screen block editing
- Gentle structural affordances
- Semantic cues without noise

---

## Risks

- Accidental model erosion
- UI‑only state

These risks must be actively resisted.

---

## Execution Plan

- [Phase 2 — Desktop App (Detailed Plan)](../plan/phase2-desktop.md) — 2A–2D complete, 2E not started
