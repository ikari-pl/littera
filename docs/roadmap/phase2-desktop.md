## Goal

Provide a calm, WYSIWYG‑leaning writing environment backed by Littera’s model.

---

## Principles

- Metadata is hidden, not destroyed
- Structure persists invisibly
- Writing flow is prioritized

---

## Capabilities

- Full‑screen block editing
- Gentle structural affordances
- Semantic cues without noise

---

## Risks

- Accidental model erosion
- UI‑only state

These risks must be actively resisted.
