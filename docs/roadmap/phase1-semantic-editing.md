# Phase 1 — Semantic Editing

## Goal

Enable meaningful editing while preserving structure and semantics.

---

## Scope

- Edit block text safely
- Edit work‑specific entity notes
- Explicit edit modes (browse / edit)
- No autosave; explicit intent only

---

## Non‑Goals

- Rich text formatting
- Inline AI generation
- Collaborative editing

---

## Success Criteria

- Editing never breaks structure
- All edits are representable via CLI
- Semantics remain explicit
