# Littera Roadmap

This roadmap describes the *intended evolution* of Littera.

It is not a feature wishlist. It is a sequencing of ideas, interfaces, and guarantees.

The model comes first. Everything else follows.

## Phases

- Phase 0 — Foundations (complete)
- Phase 1 — Semantic Editing
- Phase 2 — Immersive Desktop Writing
- Phase 3 — Scale and Longevity

Each phase assumes the previous phase is stable.
