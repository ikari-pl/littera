# Littera Roadmap

This roadmap describes the *intended evolution* of Littera.

It is not a feature wishlist. It is a sequencing of ideas, interfaces, and guarantees.

The model comes first. Everything else follows.

---

## Phases

- Phase 0 — Foundations (complete)
- Phase 1 — Semantic Editing
- Phase 2 — Immersive Desktop Writing
- Phase 3 — Scale and Longevity

Each phase assumes the previous phase is stable.

Phase documents define **vision and principles** (the "why").
Detailed execution checklists live in `docs/plan/` (the "how").
Phase principles are also encoded in `CLAUDE.md` for agent enforcement.
